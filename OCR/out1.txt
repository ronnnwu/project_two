1. Introduction

We present the ﬁrst. exel sixe obsormtion of tr? a lt‘ddt‘otttC r + jets events. With these emits, we measure
the tf production ems tiou iii pp collisions at ﬂ : 1.06 TeV with the CDF detector [3 at. the Te "atrou at

2.1. Neural Network for QCD Multijets Removal

 

The dominant hsekgmmid for this analysis is high jet multipli ’ty QCD events with one of the jets faking
the signature of a r lepton. To further rednee the QCD multijets background, we developed ‘dtt srtihe d1 neural
network (NN) to distinguish between tnie tt’ 4) r + jets emits and QCD multih . emits. First, we ereste
a sample onCD mnltJ ~t from data by. leetiiig event. with a r with no tmek .elstieii requirement. The
NN is trained to distinguish between th eleeted QCD mnltijets emits and ti, eveiits gmmratod with the
PYTHIA MC generator E where the T de ,dy s handled by the TA 4011A package to properly account for the
r polarization. We use 8 variables to train the NN: ET: load jet ET, sum ET of the j and r lepton, sum
ET of the two lowest ET jets and the r lepton, sum ET of the two liigl ET jet tmiisvei momentum of
